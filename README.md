## 1. Introduction

Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) for topic modelling is a powerful technique in business analytics. It enables organisations to uncover key themes and patterns within large volumes of unstructured text data.

In this project, topic modelling was applied to support a global fitness and gym operator by streamlining the extraction of insights from customer reviews. Instead of manually sifting through thousands of text entries, automated topic modelling helped surface hidden trends, customer pain points, and recurring themes in the feedback.

By grouping feedback into data-driven themes and combining it with sentiment analysis, the project delivered clear, actionable insights that informed service improvement across multiple locations.

By leveraging this approach, the business can make faster, data-driven decisions and enhance its strategic planning ‚Äî all rooted in a deeper understanding of customer sentiment and experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

The business objective was to uncover the factors influencing member satisfaction and dissatisfaction‚Äîparticularly identifying what drives negative reviews and how these insights can be leveraged for service improvement.

The datasets comprised 12 months of real-world customer reviews from two major platforms: Google and Trustpilot. This analysis aimed to extract actionable insights using NLP techniques, including topic modelling and sentiment analysis, to improve overall member experience.

The key goals were:
- Identify themes contributing to negative feedback  
- Highlight recurring issues across locations  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer satisfaction

Ultimately, the project provided a clear prioritisation of customer pain points ‚Äî such as service quality and cleanliness ‚Äî and translated those into targeted actions for the business.

üìç **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
‚Ä¢ Combined and cleaned over 30,000 reviews from Google and Trustpilot.  
‚Ä¢ Focused on reviews with a score below 3 stars, which accounted for 20.65% (6,293 reviews) of the dataset.  

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image1.png" alt="Image1" width="600"/>
</h3>

‚Ä¢ Applied regular expressions and text normalisation to clean the review texts, removing noise such as punctuation and stopwords.

---

üåç **Location Analysis**  
‚Ä¢ Among all features analysed, location emerged as a consistent factor in review sentiment.  
‚Ä¢ While the dataset reflected a global customer base, location data remained relatively sparse, and no single site accounted for a dominant share of negative feedback.  
‚Ä¢ Analysis of the top 30 locations by review volume revealed a notable concentration in London-based locations, which collectively contributed a significant portion of the feedback. This urban clustering suggests that higher-traffic areas may naturally attract more user commentary and scrutiny.

---

üß† **NLP Modelling & Analysis**  
‚Ä¢ Conducted topic modelling using BERTopic and Gensim's LDA to identify recurring themes in customer feedback across sentiment types and locations.  
‚Ä¢ Employed BERT for emotion classification, adding a sentiment layer to distinguish between positive, neutral, and negative emotional tones in the reviews.  
‚Ä¢ Incorporated the advanced Phi-4 language model for generating targeted, actionable insights based on identified topics and sentiment trends, providing strategic value to the business.

---

üìä **Visualisation & Interpretation**  
Produced visualisations to:  
‚Ä¢ Map out topic distributions across sentiment categories  
‚Ä¢ Highlight word importance and thematic clusters  
‚Ä¢ Show sentiment and emotional tone breakdowns  

These visual tools enabled a more intuitive interpretation of the data, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify key issues, emotional drivers, and trends across regions and customer experiences.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing

After isolating reviews with negative ratings, an analysis of the most frequent words revealed a clear shift in tone. While common terms such as "equipment," "staff," "classes," and "machines" remained dominant, positive descriptors like "great," "good," "friendly," and "easy" disappeared. In their place, more critical or dissatisfied language emerged ‚Äî including terms like "don‚Äôt," "time," "membership," "get," "use," and "like" ‚Äî highlighting a transition toward problem-focused feedback.

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image3.png" alt="Image3" width="900"/>
</h3>

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image4.png" alt="Image4" width="700"/>
</h3>

Even when narrowing the scope to a refined subset of 980 reviews (from the top 30 locations), the same top words persisted. This consistency across both the full and filtered datasets reinforces that key issues are deeply embedded in member experiences. While some words like "equipment" or "people" appear in both positive and negative contexts, they still provide crucial context for downstream modelling ‚Äî especially when paired with sentiment classification.

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image5.png" alt="Image5" width="900"/>
</h3>

The initial topic modelling phase, conducted without large language models (LLMs), offered a broad overview of global trends in gym member complaints. This foundational step helped surface high-level themes and paved the way for deeper, more targeted analyses in the later stages of the project.

## 5. Emotional Analysis

The initial emotional analysis was conducted using the bhadresh-savani/bert-base-uncased-emotion model through a standard text classification pipeline. 

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image6.png" alt="Image6" width="800"/>
</h3>

While this model offered a quick setup and broad emotion categories, it showed notable inconsistencies ‚Äî for instance, misclassifying clearly negative reviews as "joy" or "sadness." 

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image7.png" alt="Image7" width="900"/>
</h3>

Upon closer inspection, many of these reviews expressed anger or frustration, revealing that the model struggled with context-sensitive emotional cues common in customer feedback.

To improve accuracy, a more refined model ‚Äî AnkitAI/deberta-v3-base-emotion, a DeBERTa-based classifier ‚Äî was applied. 

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image8.png" alt="Image8" width="800"/>
</h3>

This upgrade significantly reduced misclassification, better aligning predicted emotions with the actual tone of the feedback. It particularly excelled at identifying "anger", which emerged as the most prevalent emotion, present in 493 reviews.

While some degree of misclassification still persists, this model demonstrated a much stronger understanding of sentiment in context, making it a more reliable tool for downstream analysis.

It's also worth noting that many widely-used emotional categories ‚Äî such as anger, sadness, joy, fear, love, and surprise ‚Äî are grounded in psychological or storytelling frameworks. In the context of real-world customer experience, however, emotions like "disappointment," "frustration," and "trust" are often more relevant and informative.

This highlights an opportunity for future work: fine-tuning emotion models to detect business-relevant emotional categories could lead to richer, more actionable insights that align more closely with customer expectations and strategic goals.

## 6. Generating Actionable Insights with Phi-4

To deepen the analysis, the Phi-4 large language model (LLM) was employed to generate targeted, actionable insights from customer reviews ‚Äî with a specific focus on feedback expressing anger, the most common negative emotion identified earlier.

Phi-4 works as a decoder-style transformer, designed to understand context and produce human-like text. In this use case, it was used to extract the top 3 pain points from individual reviews, helping surface specific issues directly from customer language.

While this approach offered valuable granularity, it operated at a more micro level, limiting its ability to detect broader patterns across the full dataset.

To capture higher-level trends, BERTopic was used alongside Phi-4. While Phi-4 generated review-level insights, BERTopic clustered reviews into broader themes, uncovering structural patterns in customer feedback. Notably, Topic 0 ‚Äî the largest cluster with over 1,000 reviews ‚Äî reflected a wide range of complaints grouped under a general theme. BERTopic helped distil these into clearer subtopics, revealing consistent issues across locations.

<h3 align="center">
  <img src="Images/Image9.png" alt="Image9" width="900"/>
</h3>

Together, these models provided both depth and breadth: Phi-4 highlighted specific pain points, while BERTopic offered a macro view of common complaint patterns, helping the business prioritise actionable areas for improvement.
