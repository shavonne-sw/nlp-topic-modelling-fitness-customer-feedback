## 1. Introduction

Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) for topic modelling is a powerful technique in business analytics. It enables organizations to uncover key themes and patterns within large volumes of unstructured text data.

In this project, topic modelling was applied to support a global fitness and gym operator by streamlining the extraction of insights from customer reviews. Instead of manually sifting through thousands of text entries, automated topic modelling helped surface hidden trends, customer pain points, and recurring themes in the feedback.

By leveraging this approach, the business can make faster, data-driven decisions and enhance its strategic planning ‚Äî all rooted in a deeper understanding of customer sentiment and experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

The business objective was to uncover the factors influencing member satisfaction and dissatisfaction‚Äîparticularly identifying what drives negative reviews and how these insights can be leveraged for service improvement.

The datasets comprised 12 months of real-world customer reviews from two major platforms: Google and Trustpilot. This analysis aimed to extract actionable insights using NLP techniques, including topic modelling and sentiment analysis, to improve overall member experience.

The key goals were:
- Identify themes contributing to negative feedback  
- Highlight recurring issues across locations  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer satisfaction

</h3>

üìç **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
‚Ä¢ Combined and cleaned over 30,000 reviews from Google and Trustpilot.  
‚Ä¢ Focused on reviews with a score below 3 stars, which accounted for 20.65% (6,293 reviews) of the dataset.  
‚Ä¢ Applied regular expressions and text normalisation to clean the review texts, removing noise such as punctuation and stopwords.

üåç **Location Analysis**  
‚Ä¢ Among all features analysed, location emerged as a consistent factor in review sentiment.  
‚Ä¢ While the dataset reflected a global customer base, location data remained relatively sparse, and no single site accounted for a dominant share of negative feedback.  
‚Ä¢ Analysis of the top 30 locations by review volume revealed a notable concentration in London-based locations, which collectively contributed a significant portion of the feedback. This urban clustering suggests that higher-traffic areas may naturally attract more user commentary and scrutiny.

üß† **NLP Modelling & Analysis**  
‚Ä¢ Conducted topic modelling using BERTopic and Gensim's LDA to identify recurring themes in customer feedback across sentiment types and locations.  
‚Ä¢ Employed BERT for emotion classification, adding a sentiment layer to distinguish between positive, neutral, and negative emotional tones in the reviews.  
‚Ä¢ Incorporated the advanced Phi-4 language model for generating targeted, actionable insights based on identified topics and sentiment trends, providing strategic value to the business.

üìä **Visualisation & Interpretation**  
Produced visualisations to:  
‚Ä¢ Map out topic distributions across sentiment categories  
‚Ä¢ Highlight word importance and thematic clusters  
‚Ä¢ Show sentiment and emotional tone breakdowns  

These visual tools enabled a more intuitive interpretation of the data, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify key issues, emotional drivers, and trends across regions and customer experiences.
